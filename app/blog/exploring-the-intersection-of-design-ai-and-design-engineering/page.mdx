# Broadband labels for Comcast Business

- **Platform**: Responsive web
- **Year**: 2024
- **Client**: Leading US Telco
- **Role**: IC - UX Designer

## Project Brief

In early 2023, new FCC regulations required all internet service providers to display “broadband nutrition labels” 
on every plan, showing fixed, plain-language information about price, speeds, contract terms, and fees. 

The challenge? 
Our client had to redesign web and mobile experiences across highly trafficked sales flows to add these disclosures, 
all under a six-month deadline—without eroding conversion, hurting pricing transparency, or confusing customers. 
This case study details how we combined rapid research, iterative design, and cross-functional teamwork to launch a compliant, 
user-friendly labelling system serving **over 7.8 million unique visitors**.

## Impact Created

<ImpactMetrics 
  metrics={[
    { value: "7.8 M", label: "Unique digital visitors" },
    { value: "$6.4 M", label: "Generated FY23 revenue" },
    { value: "10+", label: "Users validated" },
    { value: "50+", label: "Components built" }
  ]} 
/>

## The Problem

- **Regulatory Risk**: Non-compliance risked legal penalties and damaging corporate reputation.
- **Experience Risk**: Competition was fierce, but as this was a new regulation, no major competitors had implemented broadband labels yet—no patterns to follow.
- **User Risk**: New mandatory information could overwhelm users or interrupt their buying journey.
- **Business Goals**: Remain conversion-focused while achieving full FCC compliance, and minimize customer support burdens due to confusion.

## Initial Research and Insights

Studied FCC documentation and breakdowns of the nutrition label design; reviewed competitor (AT&T, Verizon, Spectrum) sites and found no models or industry best practices yet, **confirming we would set the standard**.
We also collaborated early with legal, marketing, analytics, and engineering to capture constraints and success metrics for business, compliance, and content strategy.

### Key Principles of Design Engineering

1. **Systems Thinking**: Viewing a design holistically ensures all components work together cohesively.
2. **Collaboration**: Effective communication between designers and developers is crucial for successful outcomes.
3. **Iterative Process**: Building, testing, and refining are fundamental to achieving the best results.

### Tools of the Trade

Modern design engineers leverage tools like:

- **Figma** and **Sketch** for prototyping
- **Motion** for creating smooth animations
- **Tailwind CSS** for streamlined styling
- **Git** for version control and collaboration

## AI and Design Engineering: A Symbiotic Relationship

The integration of AI into design engineering creates powerful synergies:

- **Prototyping with AI**: AI-driven tools like ChatGPT assist in generating content for prototypes, accelerating the design process.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Engineers use AI to predict performance issues and optimize designs in real-time.
- **Accessibility Improvements**: AI tools automatically detect and fix accessibility concerns, ensuring compliance.

### Case Study: Motion-Primitives

Motion-Primitives demonstrates how AI and design engineering come together. By leveraging Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS, it simplifies the creation of dynamic, responsive interfaces. AI can enhance this by:

- Generating motion patterns based on user preferences.
- Optimizing performance for different devices.
- Automating testing for cross-browser compatibility.

## Conclusion

The intersection of AI, design, and design engineering is reshaping the industry. By embracing AI while staying grounded in design principles, professionals can push boundaries and create experiences that are both innovative and human-centered. The future lies in collaboration—not only between humans and machines but also among designers, engineers, and AI.
