# Broadband labels for Comcast Business

- **Platform**: Responsive web
- **Year**: 2024
- **Client**: Leading US Telco
- **Role**: IC - UX Designer

## Project Brief

In early 2023, new FCC regulations required all internet service providers to display “broadband nutrition labels” 
on every plan, showing fixed, plain-language information about price, speeds, contract terms, and fees. 

The challenge? 
Our client had to redesign web and mobile experiences across highly trafficked sales flows to add these disclosures, 
all under a six-month deadline—without eroding conversion, hurting pricing transparency, or confusing customers. 
This case study details how we combined rapid research, iterative design, and cross-functional teamwork to launch a compliant, 
user-friendly labelling system serving **over 7.8 million unique visitors**.

## Impact Created

<ImpactMetrics 
  metrics={[
    { value: "7.8 M", label: "Unique digital visitors" },
    { value: "$6.4 M", label: "Generated FY23 revenue" },
    { value: "10+", label: "Users validated" },
    { value: "50+", label: "Components built" }
  ]} 
/>

## The Problem

- **Regulatory Risk**: Non-compliance risked legal penalties and damaging corporate reputation.
- **Experience Risk**: Competition was fierce, but as this was a new regulation, no major competitors had implemented broadband labels yet—no patterns to follow.
- **User Risk**: New mandatory information could overwhelm users or interrupt their buying journey.
- **Business Goals**: Remain conversion-focused while achieving full FCC compliance, and minimize customer support burdens due to confusion.

## Initial Research and Insights

Studied FCC documentation and breakdowns of the nutrition label design; reviewed competitor (AT&T, Verizon, Spectrum) sites and found no models or industry best practices yet, **confirming we would set the standard**.
We also collaborated early with legal, marketing, analytics, and engineering to capture constraints and success metrics for business, compliance, and content strategy.

## Iterations & User Testing

We prioritized launching an MVP in the fastest way possible, selecting the 
“plan selection” and “offer details”  screens for direct-to-visual design (skipping wireframes to 
leverage our robust design system). 

After MVP completion, we tested the new flows with six real users, focusing 
on discoverability, clarity, and conversion ease. Their feedback centred on label prominence, 
benefits ordering, and interaction with FAQs.
