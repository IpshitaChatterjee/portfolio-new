## Project brief
For this project, I worked on the loan help requests ticketing system for the Correspondent experience. 

### Who is a Correspondent?
A Correspondent is usually a company comprising a group of lenders that purchase home loans using their own money. 
They then sell these loans to Chase to make a profit. After the sale, Chase typically manages the loan for the new homeowners.

### What are loan help requests?
The correspondent lending process can often be lengthy and typically involves numerous checks and processes before Chase 
decides to purchase the loan. During this process, either the Correspondent may need information updates from Chase, or Chase may 
need some more details from the Correspondent. To facilitate this experience, we have created a ticketing system for raising and managing requests.

### Who acts on these requests?
Loan agents who are equipped to work with correspondents take up these requests.

## The Problem
Although the ticketing system (correspondent-facing) existed, it had not been updated since 2000 
and was due for not only a visual but also an experience upgrade. 

### EPIC requirements
- Update legacy ticket submission portal for Correspondents.
- We are also in the process of stereamilining all client experiences on a new Chase Investor Portal, 
and the new ticketing portal had to account for the constraints the portal presented.
- The Chase investor portal in itself did not have a cohesive set of design pattern documentation. 
So far, the designs had been created randomly, and the application as a whole looked fragmented.
- We also had to devise a method to keep Correspondents updated as and when their tickets change status. 
Currently, this is not being done.
